        <h1>Review of Mass Effect: Andromeda</h1>
        <p>
            Mass Effect: Andromeda, is the fourth major installment in the Mass Effect series. Set 600 years after the
            events of the original trilogy. You play as one of the Ryder twins (Scott or Sara) who after events at the
            beginning of the game become the Pathfinder. The game follows the Andromeda Initiative who are trying to
            find new "Golden Worlds" for those from the Milky Way had somewhere to live when they were woken from
            cryo-sleep. They soon realise that a lot of the worlds aren't viable and require mass terraforming for them
            to be habitable, also the discovery of the Kett a hostile alien species see those from the Milky Way as
            intruders and immediately were hostile. Eventually after terraforming the "Golden Worlds" there was the
            discovery of Meridian which is THE "Golden World" and becomes the haven for the Initiative. At the end of
            the game there is a tranmission from missing Ark that held the Quarians and had disappeared soon after the
            arrival in Andromeda.
