        <div class="paragraph1" id="general-info">
            <p>
                Mass Effect originally was released in 2007 for the Xbox 360, then in 2008 it was ported to PC and PS3,
                furthermore with the release of Mass Effect: Legendary Edition the first game was remastered. It was
                developed by BioWare and published Microsoft Game Studios, in where the player controls Commander
                Shepard who is a human soldier who at the beginning of the game has been tasked with finding a beacon,
                which is a ancient storage device, where they see visions of an ancient race of sentient machines known
                as the Reapers. Shepherd is customizable to the players liking, with a number of companions that the
                player can recruit to help with their mission. There are plenty opportunities for exploration with many
                different side quests which some can have affects on the sequel games.
