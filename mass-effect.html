        <h1>Review of Mass Effect</h1>
        <p>
            Mass Effect originally was released in 2007 for the Xbox 360, then in 2008 it was ported to PC and PS3,
            furthermore with the release of Mass Effect: Legendary Edition the first game was remastered. It was
            developed by BioWare and published Microsoft Game Studios, in where the player controls Commander Shepherd 
            who is a human soldier who at the beginning of the game has been tasked with finding a beacon, which is a ancient storage
            device, where they see visions of an ancient race of sentient machines known as the Reapers. Shepherd is customizable to 
            the players liking, with a number of companions that the player can recruit to help with their mission. There are plenty
            opportunities for exploration with many different side quests which some can have affects on the sequel games.
