        <h1>Review of Mass Effect 3</h1>
        <p>
            Mass Effect 3 is the last game in the story of Commander Shepherd, released in 2012 developed by BioWare
            and published by EA. After the events of Mass Effect 2 Shepherd has been relieved of duty and stripped of
            his rank due to his time with Cerberus. He has been kept around as an "advisor" on how to deal with the 
            Reapers. After the games start, Earth has been attacked by the Reapers. Shepherd is then re-instated, and 
            is then tasked with going to the council races to gather allies to save Earth again through the players choices 
            allies will be gathered, among these allies are a lot of familiar faces from previous games after this has 
            been completed, the final battle commmences which leads to arguably one of the most controversial ending
            in gaming, leaving many fans upset even to this day.
