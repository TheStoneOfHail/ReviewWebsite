        <h1>Review of Mass Effect 3</h1>
        <div class="paragraph1" id="general-info">
            <p>
                Mass Effect 3 is the last game in the story of Commander Shepard, released in 2012 developed by BioWare
                and published by EA. After the events of Mass Effect 2 Shepard has been relieved of duty and stripped of
                his rank due to his time with Cerberus. He has been kept around as an "advisor" on how to deal with the
                Reapers. After the games start, Earth has been attacked by the Reapers. Shepard is then re-instated, and
                is then tasked with going to the council races to gather allies to save Earth again through the players
                choices allies will be gathered, among these allies are a lot of familiar faces from previous games
                after this has been completed, the final battle commmences which leads to arguably one of the most
                controversial ending in gaming, leaving many fans upset even to this day.
