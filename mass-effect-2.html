        <h1>Review of Mass Effect 2</h1>
        <div class="paragraph1" id="general-info">
            <p>
                Mass Effect is the direct sequel to Mass Effet (2007), which was released in 2010 developed by Bioware
                and published by EA with the return of Commander Shepard and a host of new crew mates for the player to
                meet. Mass Effect 2 begins 6 months after the events of the first game, with the Normandy reconning the
                Traverse for any signs of the Reapers, when the Normandy is attacked by an unindentified ship which
                leads to the destruction of the Normandy and the "death" of Commander Shepherd, fast forward 2 years and
                Shepherd has been ressurected by a human black-ops organization called Cerberus, led by the Illusive Man
                who has asked Shepherd to investigate disappearences of human colonies across the system. Which the
                player finds out that it is a race called the Collectors who are puppets of the Reapers.

                Mass Effect 2 takes a lot of what the first game had and fleshes out the gameplay out, making it a lot
                more smoother.
