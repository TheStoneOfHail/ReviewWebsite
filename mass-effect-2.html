        <h1>Review of Mass Effect 2</h1>
        <p>
            Mass Effect is the direct sequel to Mass Effet (2007), which was released in 2010 developed by Bioware and
            published by EA with the return of Commander Shepherd and a host of new crew mates for the player to meet.
            Mass Effect 2 begins 6 months after the events of the first game, with the Normandy reconning the Traverse
            for any signs of the Reapers, when the Normandy is attacked by an unindentified ship which leads to the
            destruction of the Normandy and the "death" of Commander Shepherd, fast forward 2 years and Shepherd has
            been ressurected by a human black-ops organization called Cerberus, led by the Illusive Man who has asked
            Shepherd to investigate disappearences of human colonies across the system. Which the player finds out that 
            it is a race called the Collectors who are puppets of the Reapers.

        <p>
            Mass Effect 2 takes a lot of what the first game had and fleshes out the gameplay out, making it a lot more
            smoother.
